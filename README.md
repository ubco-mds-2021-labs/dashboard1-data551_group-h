## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In United States, we have lot of parents who are worried about the future prospects of their children especially after high school or undergrad in terms of university selection to pursue higher studies. But for them it is very difficult to decide which institutions to prefer because of lesser knowledge and complex factors involved. As a result, they eventually take the services of a very famous Educational Advisory firm situated in New York which helps them in selecting institutions/universities based on various factors like tuition fees, region, salary after graduation, type etc. The firm has hired us as a Data Scientists of team of three to come up with an overall visualizations and Dashboard providing some quality Analysis/patterns based on which they can provide some useful and quality suggestions for their clients

We will be visualizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 colleges & universities across the United States. Each university has a number of variables that describe the state where the school is located (state, state_code), the type of school (public, private, for-profit), the degree_length of the program (4-year, 2-year), and the cost of the program (room_and_board, in_state_tuition, in_state_total, out_of_state_tuition, out_of_state_total). We will also integrate another dataset that contains the salary potential for about 1,000 schools. We will join these 2 datasets together by school name and use the joined dataset for the visualization.

## Description of our app & sketch

The app contains a U.S. map that shows all the states. The map is interactive and users can click on a state to show the information for that state. Below the map is a filter menu which can be used to adjust which schools will be displayed according to several selecting criteria (school type, degree length, state, in/out state, whether it has room & board and tuition range). A list of all the schools that meet the selecting criteria will be displayed in the top-right box, showing the detailed cost for that school. Below the school list are two bar chart, comparing the selected school's tuition and the projected salary potential with the state average and nation average.
